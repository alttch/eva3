       and agrees to such actions of the Supplier. If the User cannot or does
       not want to download and install auxiliary software on the device,
       comply with other instructions of the Supplier, or if the Supplier
       acknowledges that the User’s Device does not meet the requirements for
       obtaining technical support, the Supplier has the right to refuse from
       provision of technical support.
