Extending HOWTO
***************

There are several different ways to extend EVA ICS functionality, each one is
preferred for the certain tasks.

I/O
===

* :doc:`item_scripts` (:doc:`/uc/uc`) - exchange data with an equipment,
  quickly and dirty 

* :doc:`PHI modules<phi_development>` (:doc:`/uc/uc`) - exchange data with an
  equipment in a proper and fast way 

Logic
=====

* :doc:`corescript` - tiny Python snippets to handle events, quickly and dirty

* :doc:`/lm/macros` (:doc:/`lm/lm`) - tiny scripts to handle event logic or be
  executed on request

* :doc:`/lm/ext` (:doc:`/lm/lm`) - extend functionality of logic macros to
  implement certain features

Plug-ins
========

* :doc:`plugins` - applications and function libraries that run inside EVA ICS.
  This is the most advanced way to extend EVA ICS functionality: plug-ins can
  implement all of the above plus much and much more.
