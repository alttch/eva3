    "help": "\nSolves typical logic task: turning the motor direction and run the motor for\nthe specified number of seconds, to control i.e. window opening, door opening,\nmanipulators of the robots.\n\nThe duration of the motor work is specified in 'steps' unit driver\nconfiguration param, each step corresponds to the next status.\n\nWarmup is used to let the motor additional number of seconds for the starting\nstates between first and last.\n\nTuning is used to make sure the motor drivers the target to starting and\nfinishing position (i.e. completely opens/closes the door).\n\nts and te. Sometimes it's pretty hard to calculate the proper position for the\nmiddle states. In this case LPI will ask motor to go all the way to the start\nstate (if target status <= ts) and then back to the target, or all the way to\nthe end and to the target (if target status >= te).\n\nUnit driver config fields should have property 'port' with a\nport label/number for PHI. 'io_label' prop allows to rename 'port', 'dport'\ni.e. to 'socket', 'dsocket' for a more fancy unit configuration.  Each port and\ndport may be specified as a single value or contain an array of values, in this\ncase multiple ports are used simultaneously.\n\nYou may set i: before the port label/number, i.e. i:2, to return/use inverted\nport state. This works both for power and direction ports.\n",
