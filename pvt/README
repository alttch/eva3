pvt dir is used by EVA SFA to serve private content (camera images, room plans, unit/rule IDs etc.)
securely and avoid loading it with the main UI until the user is logged in

You should always use /pvt function of SFA API unless SFA server is additionally secured by frontend
or run in a 100% trusted environment

PVT dir permissions are controlled by 'pvt' option in sfa_apikeys.ini
