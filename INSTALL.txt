Install pip3, libjpeg-dev, libjpeg8-dev, run sh install.sh it will do the rest

if you are not planning to run LM or SFA as user another than root, change runtime/lm* and runtime/sfa* ownership

Patch the following libs:

ws4py
    manager.py - patch logger.error to info
    websocket.py - patch logger.error to info

urllib3
    connectionpool.py - remove warning
        Unverified HTTPS request is being made
        remove ssl verify https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html

if PID files are modified in configs, change them in sbin/*-control

for UC: Edit etc/uc.ini and etc/uc_apikeys.ini, run sbin/uc-control start
for LM: Edit etc/lm.ini and etc/lm_apikeys.ini, run sbin/lm-control start
for SFA: Edit etc/sfa.ini and etc/sfa_apikeys, run sbin/sfa-control start

Rotate log/uc.log, log/lm.log, log/sfa.log, i.e. with logrotate, after rotation launch "*-control logrotate"

if installed on the same server, launch UC first, then (after i.e. 3-5 seconds delay) LM PLC, then after same delay SFA

or 

use ./sbin/eva-control (requires bash). Before using this script, edit ./etc/eva_servers (use ./etc/eva_servers-dist as a template) and set
required servers to yes
