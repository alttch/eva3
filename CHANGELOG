    - EVA_ITEM_PARENT_GROUP variable in script ENV which contains the parent group of the item

    - cvars now can be set as global or assigned to the specified item group
        i.e. 'VAR1' - global cvar, available to the all scripts, 'group1/VAR2' - variable available
         only to scripts from group 'group1' (as 'VAR2'), 'group2/VAR2' - variable available only
         to group 'group2' (also as 'VAR2'). Used by UC scripts to let one script manage different items

    Universal Controller

    - 'update_delay' - item passive update may start with a delay to prevent multiple updates
        run simultaneously producing high system load

    UC API and uc-cmd:

    - 'clone' function in UC API and uc-cmd to clone items
    - 'clone_group' function in UC API and uc-cmd for cloning all matching items in a group
    - 'destroy_group' function destroys all items in the specified group

    Logic Manager

    - item id in LM rules match by simple mask (i.e. '*id*' or 'id*' or '*id')
