         only to scripts from group 'group1' (as 'VAR2'), 'group2/VAR2' - variable available only
         to group 'group2' (also as 'VAR2'). Used by UC scripts to let one script manage different items

        run simultaneously producing high system load

    - 'clone' function in UC API and uc-cmd to clone items
    - 'clone_group' function in UC API and uc-cmd for cloning all matching items in a group
    - 'destroy_group' function destroys all items in the specified group
