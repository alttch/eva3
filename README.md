![What is EVA ICS](doc/promo/what-is-eva-ics.png?raw=true "What is EVA ICS")

Automated control systems are facing a new stage of evolution: IoT-devices
become interesting for those, who have never dealt with automation, cheap
programmable devices become reliable enough for industrial use, commercial
solutions move away from old protocols and involve computer networks instead.
We do not reform automation â€“ we change the approach: taking the classical
technology as a basis, we simplify everything else to the maximum. Automation
is simple and available for everyone!
