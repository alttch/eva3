![What is EVA ICS](doc/promo/what-is-eva-ics.png?raw=true "What is EVA ICS")

Automated control systems are facing a new stage of evolution: IoT-devices
become interesting for those, who have never dealt with automation, cheap
programmable devices become reliable enough for industrial use, commercial
solutions move away from old protocols and involve computer networks instead.
We do not reform automation â€“ we change the approach: taking the classical
technology as a basis, we simplify everything else to the maximum. Automation
is simple and available for everyone!

Using MQTT protocol, EVA ICS allows to set up single IoT/IIoT management node
and then easily scale it to your own automation Cloud, where nodes and
components discover each other automatically.

You design IoT set up. EVA ICS builds it for you.
