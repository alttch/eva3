EVA ICS allows to set up single IoT/IIoT management node and then easily scale
it to own private ultra-secure automation Cloud, where nodes and components
discover each other automatically via the Internet or local communications.

The powerful Industry-4.0 deployment system allows quickly setting up new nodes
and easily switching between pre-production and production configurations.

You design IoT setup. EVA ICS builds it for you.
